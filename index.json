[{"categories":null,"contents":"Who am I?\nI am a current graduate student in Columbia University and also an intern in Knowledge Graph Conference. Experienced in data engineering and product management. And learning knowledge graph recently.\nWhat is this?\nThis Food Knowledge Graph is based on the initiative of health and sustainability in the Covid-19 period. Most people would have to cook during this quarantine and some people rarely cooked before. Wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be great if we have a website to search for recipes and ingredients when we don\u0026rsquo;t know what to cook or eat? As a food enthusiast and a beginner in knowledge graph, with the generous support from my supervisor François Scharffe, I build this food knowledge graph and visualize it with this website.\nNow we could look into the recipes to see their recipes and vise versa. Of course, this is just a start. More and more interesting information and user experience could be added here to enrich the content and amplify the features. For example, the nutrition data, food product, recommended restaurant and fun fact of each recipes and ingredients.\nInterested already?\nFeel free to contact me or join our wonderful Knowledge Graph Conference Slack at https://knowledgegraphconf.slack.com/join/shared_invite/zt-fwx8vfx0-98zo7w138tiMt8y7PwYs6A#/\nEnjoy and
